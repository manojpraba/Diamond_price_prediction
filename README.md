# Diamond-Price-Prediction

## **Description:**

* **Diamonds are the hardest naturally occurring substance known to man. They are made of pure carbon, arranged in a crystal structure called diamond cubic.**

* **Diamonds are found in volcanic rock, called kimberlite, which is formed when the Earth's mantle melts and rises to the surface.**

* **Diamonds can be colorless, or they can have a variety of colors, including yellow, brown, pink, blue, green, and red. The color of a diamond is determined by the impurities that are present in the carbon atoms.**

* **Diamonds are used in jewelry and in industrial applications. In jewelry, diamonds are prized for their beauty, durability, and rarity. In industry, diamonds are used for cutting, drilling, and polishing.**

* **The four Cs of diamonds are color, cut, clarity, and carat. These are the factors that determine the value of a diamond.**


## Datasets Infromation:

### Introduction About the Data :

**The dataset** The goal is to predict `price` of given diamond (Regression Analysis).

There are 10 independent variables (including `id`):

* `id` : unique identifier of each diamond
* `carat` : Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.
* `cut` : Quality of Diamond Cut
* `color` : Color of Diamond
* `clarity` : Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification
* `depth` : The depth of diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface)
* `table` : A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up
* `x` : Diamond X dimension
* `y` : Diamond Y dimension
* `x` : Diamond Z dimension

Target variable:
* `price`: Price of the given Diamond
